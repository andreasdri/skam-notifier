# SKAM Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome Extension that will notify you in the current
tab when a new post appears. 

Please note that this assumes that you will be running the server on your own. If
you do not want to do that, change `ws://localhost:8080` with `wss://skam.drivenes.net`
in `index.js`.

## Setup

Clone the repo, go to `chrome://extensions` and load the folder with the extension.

## Todo
- Someone please fix the ugly notify message.
